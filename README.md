# Wildfire-Data-Visualization
This project uses File I/O with a CSV containing data on the affects of US wildfires (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kkhandekar/total-wildfires-acres-affected-1983-2020) over a 37 year period. The first portion involves cleaning the data. This project contains two Matplotlib plots, one comparing Acres burned to Total Fires, and another comparing the costs for the Forest Service and Department of the Interior.
